Separation, Organization, Data Binding

MVVM 
foremost, a separtion pattern
model - view - viewmodel
not technology specific
works well with data binding

MVVM Compeonents

View --> ViewMode --> Model 

Model: The data, js object
View: The web page HTML, user friendly presentaion
ViewModeL: behavior and data for the view, contains propeties m methdos and the model

VS Valuable Extensions:
Web Essentials
Web Standards Update
Wovs Default Browser Switcher - not need vs2013
JSLint - JS Code anaylsis
CSSCop - Catch common CSS issues
Resharper 6 - JS refactoring (PAID)

intellisense in js files:
///<reference path="/scripts/knockout-2.0.0.debug.js"/>
resharper automataically includes intellisense in js files


1.)PMC> install-package knockoutjs
2.)PMC> install-package jquery.js
3.)place jquery-min.js, knockout-debug.js(change in production), <project>.js in on web page
4.)create js file and place in project dir below ..\scripts
5.)in js add reference path to ko.debug

if data-bind underlined for span etc ensure that html5 is selected.

Computed Members:
Define a function to evaluate a value, and use it for binding
    Eg. LasName, Phote Url, Currency Totals
When its observables change, it also notifies that changes occurred
Manage "this" Pass an owner for this, if needed
formerly known as a dependentObservable

ObservableArray:
Tracks which object are in array, not their state
Notify when items are 
-added, removed
No notification when props of item in collection change
-use ko.observable for those properties

Observable Array functons
indexOf, reverse, shift, unshift, slice, splice,replace

Subscribing to Changes:
-register to be notified when changes occur
-similiar to writing code in a property setter in .Net
-useful when you need to take action when a property changes

e.g 
vm.selectedMake.subscribe(function(){
    vm.selectedModel(undefined);//do what you want..
    }, vm)

BUILT IN BINDINGS:
text, html, value bindings, checkboes and radio buttons, drop down lists, enabling and disabling elements, setting and determining focus, handling events and binding to methods, css and styling, attributes

Built into KO
facilitate binding to attributes for elements
may use multiple binding expressions seperated by commas

attr is handy for attributes that don't have binding automatically

  value:  valueUpdate:'afterkeydown (otheroptions= change, keyup, keydown, keypress)
